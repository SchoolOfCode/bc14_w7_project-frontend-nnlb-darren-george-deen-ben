<h1>No Nerd Left Behind presents: Code<'Card'> </h1>
  The flashcard app for bootcampers! 

<h2>What is Code<Card></h2>
Code<Card> is an app built in React to help users to create their own deck of card to tailor their practice subject and test their knowledge. 

<h2>Motivation behind our app</h2>
We explored some pain points of bootcampers, ones we've felt as we've progressed on the course and provide a solution for a particular one. This painpoint being the struggle of retaining information. On the bootcamp you're constantly being thrown new concepts and there's not the luxury of time sometimes to break it down which is where we focused our persona's and userstories on.
  
Being on the bootcamp takes up a lot of time so to spend even more time to practice and solidify concepts is a huge balancing act - This is where flashcards come in and makes those 10-15mins of downtime very effective! 

<h2>Build Status</h2>
Current Build Status: V1.0
Current build allows users to generate cards from a hardcoded deck and add their own to the same deck below the "New Card" button.
Functionality for users to customise their own decks and remove cards is not yet implemented. 

<h2>How to use</h2>
To get started in an IDE, open the terminal and follow these commands: 
Clone the repo using git pull command and our https url > cd into codecards directory > npm i > npm start
